## 🏗 System Architecture

The application follows a standard **Controller-Service-Repository** pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns.



1. **Frontend:** Sends JSON requests to the API.
2. **Controller:** Handles routing and input validation (e.g., PIN checks).
3. **Data Layer:** Manages the state of the parking grid in-memory (optimized for fast demo performance).
